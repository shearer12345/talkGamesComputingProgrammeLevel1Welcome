#Games Computing Programme Level 1 Welcome

Note: Resources?? Attendance?

- overview
- we're going to play a bunch of games during this session
  - WOOT!!
  - you likely will win some, lose some, but you'll play them all :-)
  - we'll have some prizes


- First off, a bunch of mundane stuff



##Game 1

1. Get into pairs - with your new friends who are near you
2. Play Rock-Paper-Scissors, best of 3 in your pair
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
3. All winners on one side of the room, all losers on the other side

Note: need to split into two teams - doing with Rock-Paper-Scissors



##Game 2 - sorting race

- a vaguely Computer Science related game

1. The two sides of the room will race each other to sort themselves (physically) into a specific order (next slide)
  - there will be a sequence of sort constraints, the first is most important, the later ones being use for ambiguous cases
2. When your team things you are in order, your team will shout out "SORTED!"
3. We'll then confirm your order. If you're not sorted correctly the other team will win.
4. The winning team will WIN!



##Game 2 - sorting race - the order

1. **alphabetically** by **SECOND** letter of **FIRST** name
2. **alphabetically** by **THIRD** letter of **LAST** name
3. **numerically** by the **DAY** in the month of **BIRTHDAY**
4. by **HEIGHT**



##Game 3 - count off

- each half of the room will break into X teams
- down your sorted line count off from 1 to X, repeating until no-one is left
- group together with people who sounded off the same number
  - staying on your separate sides of the room



##Game 4 - Chocolate Game and Paper Game

- LHS of the room will do Chocolate Game, followed by Paper Game
- RHS of the room will do Paper Game, followed by Chocolate Game



##Game 5 - Chocolate Game

- some of you will have played this game before
- there's some (trivial) logic involved

1. each team will get into a circle
2. in each circle there will be a large bar of chocolate wrapped in paper
  - let me know if you have are allergic to Chocolate or Nuts or whatever. I have alternative options
3. in each circle there will be a scarf, a hat, a pair of gloves, a knife and a fork
4. in each circle there will be a die

###Game play

- going round the circle, each person rolls the die
- if they roll a 6, then:
  - if someone else already has the hat, scarf, gloves on then make them remove them
  - put on the hat, scarf, gloves
  - try to eat the chocolate using only the knife and fork
    - yum, yum
- repeat ad nauseam



##Game 6 - Paper Game

- giving you (hopefully fun) opportunity to ask questions
- online stopwatch??

1. each team will work together
2. come get a large sheet of paper
3. you will have 10 minutes total
4. no pens for first 3 minutes, then 7 minutes write questions and answers and fold/shape your paper
5. at least 4 questions per team
6. at least 4 answer per team


- write questions for me to answer
- write answers to "why do you want to be here studying Games Computing?"


- will have to fold/shape your piece of paper to get it as far as possible
  - team who gets their bit of paper the furthest (with writing that fulfils the criteria) will win prizes each



##Me responding to questions and discussing people's answers to why they are here
