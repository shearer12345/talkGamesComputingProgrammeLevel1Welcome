> At last, a videogame festival for everybody.

<img src="assets/nva.png" alt="gameCity" height=300>


- Every year, the best people in video games from around the world come to Nottingham to have the most fun.

- GameCity is about playing, watching, making, eating, shouting - all the best things.

- Together, we're going to find out what a videogame festival should be!

> there is no other festival in the World like GameCity ...
 - *The Guardian*

 <img src="assets/gameCity2.png" alt="gameCity" height=300>


### Interested in us (or you) organising a trip

- i.e. us booking (probably free) coaches to/from Nottingham

<img src="assets/coach.jpg" alt="coach" height=300>



## Game jams / Hackathons

- we facilitate these through the year
  - including Global Game January in the new year
- you can organise them also if you like (usually weekends)
- will be announced through blackboard
- some have prizes, some don't
- GREAT for portfolio

# mundane stuff

<img src="assets/mundane.jpg" alt="mundane" height=500>

[lea-kane.deviantart.com](http://lea-kane.deviantart.com/art/Mundane-Navi-160049442)


## Programme Leader Role

- Point of contact for students who have difficulties related to the programme
  - BUT your personal tutor is your contact for personal or academic issues
  - or your module delivery team for academic aspects
- Oversee pastoral care of students
- Manage health and wellbeing of programmes
- Respond to issues raised by students and staff of a programme nature



## We will look (briefly) at...

- The programme for this year
- Timetables
- Where things are
- Facilities in the School
- SoCS Computing Laboratories: rules, etiquette, etc.
- A bit about using computers in the University
- How you should approach studying at University



## Level 1 Modules

| Module | Semesters | CATS |
|---|---|---|
| Programming and Data Structures | A&B | 30 |
| Personal Tutoring (non-assessed) | A&B | n/a |
| Maths for Computing | A | 15 |
| Web Authoring | A | 15 |
| Introductory Game Studies | A | 15 |
| Computer Architectures | B | 15 |
| Algorithms and Complexity | B | 15 |
| Game Design  | B | 15 |



## Timetables

- Your timetable should be available when you log on to the university computer system
- Or via blackboard
- You are studying **4 modules** this semester
- Each module should have a lecture (1 or 2 hours) & a workshop session (1 or 2 hours)
- Workshops: Usually in Lab A and B
- You are expected to attend all timetabled sessions: attendance is monitored
- Week1: You only have workshops in Week 1 if after the lecture for that module ...



## Where things are

- the School of Computer Science is mainly based on the third floor of MHT building
  - computing labs
  - most of your lecturer's offices (but not all)
  - college office (admin)
- Lab sessions always on the third floor, though swipe-card door



## Lab Facilities

- 3 Computing Labs: 3rd floor MHT building
- Not running campus install, we manage them and they're on their own subnet
- All used for workshops, but you can also use them when there are no timetabled workshop sessions on


### Lab Facilities 2

- The PCs are all high-spec
  - they are not all identical between labs
  - they should all have the same software on (in general)
- All use the username "computing" with the password "computing"
  - these are **NOT** private logins (yet ...)

<img src="assets/geforce-gtx-970-header-vr-ready.png" alt="gpu" height=300>



## Lab Etiquette

- If a workshop session is on - vacate the lab, or do not enter
- **Store your work somewhere reliable** - **IMPORTANT**
  - SkyDrive
  - github/bitbucket/gitlab
  - a memory stick (though they are **NOT** reliable and get lost)
  - losing your work is not an accepted excuse for missed work
- Consider the machines as non-private, don't store passwords etc
- Remember to logout from web-services (e.g. facebook, twitter, ...)
  - browsers are in incognito mode by default to help
- The computers are regularly re-ghosted (any work saved on the local hard-drive will disappear)
- Don't bring food and drink into the lab
- Treat it like a professional dev studio



## Other Equipment

- Robotics stuff (some new fancy ones, a bunch of Rovios and Roombas kicking around), Lego NXT
- Quadcopters (John Murray)
- Mobile phones
- VR headsets (Oculus Rifts (DK1, DK2), HTC Vives ...) + we'll be getting more
- Ouyas
- Kinects (1 annd 2)
- Some Macs
- Raspberry Pis (various)
- random other stuff - keep your eyes open. Talk to people



## Blackboard

<img src="assets/blackboard.jpg" alt="blackboard" height=100>

- Blackboard is the online learning environment used by the University.
- On Blackboard you will find:
  - Sections for the modules you are studying this semester: lecture notes, workshop materials, etc.
  - announcements, your timetable, etc.
- Most assessments are submitted electronically through Blackboard.
- You can (should) test Blackboard on Friday

Note: can demo with login=“astudent”, password=“astudent”



## Library

- Next to the Engine Shed
- To log into the library system
  - http://www.library.lincoln.ac.uk
  - Separate username and PIN number (check emailed)
  - Access catalogue, reserve/renew books, access e-books
- Subject Librarian: Carole Bee
- READ BOOKS and other stuff!!!

<img src="assets/book2.jpg" alt="book2" height=250>
<img src="assets/library.png" alt="library" height=250>
<img src="assets/book1.jpg" alt="book1" height=250>



## Printing

- Large printers around the university
- You can print from any "standard" computer on campus, and collect from any printer
  - Or from our Labs
- To use printers:
  - login using library username and PIN



## What if I have a Problem?

- Extensive support structure in the University
  - not always obvious where to look for help
- Academic/work problems:
  - With a particular module: Lecturer / Module Coordinator (not always the same person)
  - Your **personal tutor**
  - Your programme leader: Me (John Shearer)
  - Your Head of School: presently Kevin Jackques (acting HoS)
  - You should feel that you can ask any member of staff for advice ...
    - this is part of all the staff members' jobs
- Non-Academic: Student Support Centre (Main Academic Building)
- **Remember: issues during Uni are common. Seek help/advice**



## Finding and contacting staff

- We, like you, are busy people
- We are not always in our offices
- Arrange meetings by email
- Write professional emails ... with our, and your names!!
- http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/socs/schoolstaff/

<img src="assets/email.png" alt="email" height=250>



## Extra Curricula Activities

- "is this part of our assessment?"
  - Remember why you are here!

- Games jams, game challenges, workshops, competitions...
- Build your portfolio
- Discover your interests
  - sports and societies
  - etc. etc.

<img src="assets/workLifeBalance.jpg" alt="email" height=250>



## Expectations

- Ours?
  - That you tell someone if you have a problem
  - That you attend timetabled sessions
  - That you follow lab rules
  - That you submit assessments on time
  - **That you treat other staff and students appropriately**
  - That you are enthusiastic!
- Yours?
  - ??
  - of us?
  - of each other?
  - of Uni?


## Advice

- Games industry is competitive
- Work outside your timetabled hours
  - i.e. 38-40 hours a week ...
- Find your interests
  - Level design, modding, hacking, mobile computing, etc
  - Your lecturers do more than teach
- If you have a problem, tell someone
- Talk to people
- Read

## FINALLY !!!



## Game 1 - another silly binary split (Rock-Paper-Scissors)

1. Get into pairs - with your new friends who are near you
2. Play Rock-Paper-Scissors, best of 3 in your pair
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
3. All victors on LHS of the room, everyone else on the RHS
  - your left/right, not my left/right

Note: need to split into two teams - doing with Rock-Paper-Scissors


## Game 1.1 - Rock-Paper-Scissors (again)

1. Find a new partner (on your side of the room)
2. Play Rock-Paper-Scissors, best of 3 in your pair
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
3. Stay on your **side** of the room
4. All victors to front of the room, everyone else to the back
  - we should now have 4 groups


## Game 1.2 - Rock-Paper-Scissors (again, again)

1. Find another new partner (in your group)
2. Play Rock-Paper-Scissors, best of 3 in your pair
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
3. Stay on your **group** of the room
4. All victors from each group get together, other also (but separately)
  - we should now have 8 groups



## Game 2 - Flying Questions Game

- will have to fold/shape your piece of paper to get it as near as possible to a target
  - team who gets nearest will win prizes each
  - the paper must **FLY** - it cannot take a predominantly ballistic path
