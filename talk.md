## Timetables

- Your timetable should be available when you log on to the university computer system
- Or via blackboard
- You are studying **4 modules** this semester
- Each module should have a lecture (1 or 2 hours) & a workshop session (1 or 2 hours)
- Workshops: Usually in Lab A and B
- You are expected to attend all timetabled sessions: attendance is monitored
- Week1: You only have workshops in Week 1 if after the lecture for that module ...



## Where things are

- the School of Computer Science is mainly based on the third floor of MHT building
  - computing labs
  - most of your lecturer's offices (but not all)
  - college office (admin)
- Lab sessions always on the third floor, though "pass key" door



## Lab Facilities

- 3 Computing Labs: 3rd floor MHT building
- Not running campus install, we manage them and they're on their own subnet
- All used for workshops, but you can also use them when there are no timetabled workshop sessions on
- The PCs are all high-spec.
  - they are not all identical between labs
  - they should all have the same software on (in general)
- All use the username "computing" with the password "computing"
  - these are **NOT** private logins, but give you admin rights


## Lab Etiquette

- If a workshop session is on - vacate the lab, or do not enter
- **Store your work somewhere reliable** - **IMPORTANT**
  - SkyDrive
  - github/bitbucket/gitlab
  - a memory stick (though they are **NOT** reliable and get lost)
  - losing your work is not an accepted excuse for missed work
- Consider the machines as non-private, don't store passwords etc
- Remember to logout from web-services (e.g. facebook, twitter, ...)
- The computers are regularly re-ghosted (any work saved on the local hard-drive will disappear)
- Don't bring food and drink into the lab
- Treat it like a professional dev studio


## Other Equipment

- Robotics stuff (some new fancy ones, a bunch of Rovios and Roombas kicking around), Lego NXT
- Quadcopters (John Murray)
- Mobile phones
- VR headsets (Oculus Rifts, ...) + we'll be getting more
- Ouyas
- Kinects
- Some Macs
- Raspberry Pis
- random other stuff - keep your eyes open. Talk to people



## Blackboard

<img src="assets/blackboard.jpg" alt="blackboard" height=100>

- Blackboard is the online learning environment used by the University.
- On Blackboard you will find:
  - Sections for the modules you are studying this semester: lecture notes, workshop materials, etc.
  - announcements, your timetable, etc.
- Most assessments are submitted electronically through Blackboard.
- You can (should) test Blackboard on Friday

Note: can demo with login=“astudent”, password=“astudent”



## Library

- Next to the Engine Shed
- To log into the library system
  - http://www.library.lincoln.ac.uk
  - Separate username and PIN number (check emailed)
  - Access catalogue, reserve/renew books, access e-books
- Subject Librarian: Carole Bee
- READ BOOKS and other stuff!!!

<img src="assets/book2.jpg" alt="book2" height=250>
<img src="assets/library.png" alt="library" height=250>
<img src="assets/book1.jpg" alt="book1" height=250>


## Printing

- Large printers around the university
- You can print from any "standard" computer on campus, and collect from any printer
  - Or from our Labs
- To use printers:
  - login using library username and PIN



## What if I have a Problem?

- Extensive support structure in the University
  - not always obvious where to look for help
- Academic/work problems:
  - With a particular module: Lecturer / Module Coordinator (not always the same person)
  - Your programme leader: Me (John Shearer)
  - Your Head of School: David Cobham
  - You should feel that you can ask any member of staff for advice ...
    - this is part of all the staff members' jobs
- Non-Academic: Student Support Centre (Main Academic Building)
- **Remember: issues during Uni are common. Seek help/advice**



## Finding and contacting staff

- We, like you, are busy people
- We are not always in our offices
- Arrange meetings by email
- Write professional emails ... with our, and your names!!
- http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/socs/schoolstaff/

<img src="assets/email.png" alt="email" height=250>



## Extra Curricula Activities

- "is this part of our assessment?"
  - Remember why you are here!

- Games jams, game challenges, workshops, competitions...
- Build your portfolio
- Discover your interests
  - sports and societies
  - etc. etc.

<img src="assets/workLifeBalance.jpg" alt="email" height=250>



## Expectations

- Ours?
  - That you tell someone if you have a problem
  - That you attend timetabled sessions
  - That you follow lab rules
  - That you submit assessments on time
  - **That you treat other staff and students appropriately**
  - That you are enthusiastic!
- Yours?
  - ??
  - of us?
  - of each other?
  - of Uni?


## Advice

- Games industry is competitive
- Work outside your timetabled hours
  - i.e. 38-40 hours a week ...
- Find your interests
  - Level design, modding, hacking, mobile computing, etc
  - Your lecturers do more than teach
- If you have a problem, tell someone
- Talk to people
- Read



## Game Time

## FINALLY !!!



## Game 1

1. Get into pairs - with your new friends who are near you


## Game 1 - Rock-Paper-Scissors

1. Get into pairs - with your new friends who are near you
2. Play Rock-Paper-Scissors, best of 3 in your pair
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
3. All victors on LHS of the room, everyone else on the RHS

Note: need to split into two teams - doing with Rock-Paper-Scissors


## Game 1.5 - Rock-Paper-Scissors (again)

1. Find a new partner (on your side of the room)
2. Play Rock-Paper-Scissors, best of 3 in your pair
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
  - 3,2,1,Shoot
3. All victors on front of the room, everyone else to the back
  - stay on your side of the room

Note: need to split into two teams - doing with Rock-Paper-Scissors



## Game 2 - sorting race

- a vaguely Computer Science related game

<img src="assets/800px-Light_on_cinema_queue.jpg" alt="800px-Light_on_cinema_queue" height=400>

[Light_on_cinema_queue](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Light_on_cinema_queue.jpg)


## Game 2 - sorting race

1. The four quarters of the room will race each other to sort themselves (physically) into a specific order (next slide)
  - there will be a sequence of sort constraints, the first is most important, the later ones being use for ambiguous cases
2. When you think your team is in order, sit down. When your whole team is sitting then jointly shout out **"SORTED!"**
3. We'll then confirm your order.
  - If sorted correctly you win
  - If not, the other team will win


## Game 2 - sorting race - the order

1. **alphabetically** by **SECOND** letter of **FIRST** name
2. **alphabetically** by **THIRD** letter of **LAST** name
3. **numerically** by the **DAY** in the month of **BIRTHDAY**
4. by **HEIGHT**

- When you think your team is in order, sit down. When your whole team is sitting then jointly shout out **"SORTED!"**

Note: using first names so they get to know each other's name



## Game 3 - Flying Questions Game

<img src="assets/Paper_450x450.jpg" alt="Paper_450x450" height=300>

[commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paperairplane.png](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paperairplane.png)


## Game 3 - Flying Questions Game

- giving you (hopefully fun) opportunity to ask questions
  - working in a team

- will have to fold/shape your piece of paper to get it as far as possible
  - team who gets their bit of paper the furthest will win prizes each (we'll do this as whole at the end)
- your paper must fulfil the following criteria:
  - at least 4 questions (for me to answer) per team
  - at least 4 answers per team to the question "why do you want to be here studying Games Computing?")


### Game Play - Flying Questions Game

1. each team will work together
2. come get a large sheet of paper and a pen
3. you will have 10 minutes total
  - first 3 minutes, no pens, just discuss
  - then 7 minutes to write questions and answers and fold/shape your paper.
  - I'll stop you and we'll put your folded/shaped paper aside for the competition at the end



### Flying Questions Game Competition

- once both teams have constructed their flying questions



## Q&A

- responding to questions and discussing people's answers to "why do you want to be here studying Games Computing?"
